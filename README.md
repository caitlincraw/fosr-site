### TODO
- Use next.js (convert from create-react-app)
- Navbar with About the Park (Amenities and History), Get Involved (Volunteer and Contact), What's Happening (News and Events), Report a Problem, About Us (Board and Partnerships)
  - Each nav item is a dropdown 
  - Use react-router for pages
- Footer with social media handles, volunteer/newsletter signup, and contact us form 
- Include interactive web map on the Report a Problem page, like "311" maps 
  - Leaflet might be the best option. Get park boundary and existing trails from OpenData.
