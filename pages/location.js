            <p>Chattanooga is located in the Hill City Neighborhood in North Chattanooga. 
                If driving to the park, access through the Spears Avenue Trailhead (ample parking and bathrooms), High Ridge Trailhead (limited on-street parking), the Bell Avenue Trailhead (currently closed, but **fingers crossed** reopening soon), and coming soon: the White Oak Park connector trailhead.
                If coming to the park by bike or foot, access through any of the trailheads above or one of the many neighborhood access points, Sawyer Street, Hiram Avenue, and Nye Circle. Please no parking at these access points. </p>
